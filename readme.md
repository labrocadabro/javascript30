If anyone should happen across this, these are my solutions for Wes Bos's [https://JavaScript30.com](Javascript 30) course.

My method is to watch the intro of the video to understand the project, write a solution of my own using the starter files, push the solution to Github, and then watch the video to for improvements/alternate methods.

As I watch the video, I make changes to the code and comment notes to myself about what I changed and what I learned. Once I've watched the full video and mades all changes/comments, I push a second time.
